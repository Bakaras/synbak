Attention Oracle(tm) Users:
synbak's Oracle database backup method is enabled in this package, but,
because Fedora Project can't provide any proprietary command or library to make synbak connect to
an Oracle database, that tools must be installed purchasing a legal licence and
using Oracle's custom installation method.

Thank You,
Fedora synbak maintainers
