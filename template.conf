## synbak 3.x main configuration file
# for quick usage instructions go to the end of this file and read FAQ file

## backup source base uri (you must provide a valid URI that will used as base address of every 'backup_source' entry)
## valid URI: file:// ssh:// rsync:// smb:// cifs:// mysql:// pgsql:// oracle:// ldap:// http:// ftp:// (the URI is dependant of backup method)
backup_source_uri		= file://
backup_source			= /bin /boot /etc /home /lib* /opt /root /sbin /srv /usr /var
backup_destination		= /srv/backup/$system/$method
backup_exclude			= /srv/backup /home/*/.gvfs /srv/storage/home/*/.gvfs

backup_method_opts		=		# extra method options (send extra arguments to the real backup command. ex: with rsync method add -A to backup ACL premissions)
backup_destination_automake	= yes		# auto make destination dir if not exist
backup_destination_prefix	= yes		# prefix the backup destination dir with backup-$system-$date name (setting to 'no' will disable the autoerase function)

## automatic backup schedule management: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
backup_schedule			= yes		# backup_schedule will enable auto managament of backup schedule (this will disable the global backup_keep option)

backup_schedule_planning	= d,w,m,y	# when execute the scheduled backups: d=daily w=weekly m=monthly y=yearly

backup_schedule_daily_keep	= 5		# keep n. backups online before erase them in daily backup (0 = disable)
backup_schedule_weekly_keep	= 4		# keep n. backups online before erase them in weekly backup (0 = disable)
backup_schedule_monthly_keep	= 12		# keep n. backups online before erase them in monthly backup (0 = disable)
backup_schedule_yearly_keep	= 1		# keep n. backups online before erase them in yearly backup (0 = disable)

backup_schedule_daily_cron	= 1,2,3,4,5	# (format: use the crontab(5) format) days of the week when make backups. (from 1 = monday to 7 = sunday)
backup_schedule_weekly_cron	= 6		# (format: from 1 to 7) specify only one day of the week when make backups. ex: use 7 to run weekly backups on sunday
backup_schedule_monthly_cron	= 31		# (format: from 1 to 31) day of the mounth when make backup (31 is aways the last day of the month)
backup_schedule_yearly_cron	= 12-31		# (format: MONTH-DAY) month and day when make yearly backup

## oneshot backup management (used when backup_schedule=no)
backup_keep			= 5		# keep online max n. backups, then autoerase older backups (only if backup_keep_on_errors=no or no error occour)
backup_keep_on_errors		= yes		# keep old backups if any error occour in a backup step, otherwise erase old backups

## method specific options
method_concurrent_limit		= 1		# this allow synbak to run n. cuncurrent backup job at same time for this system
method_rsync_sudo		= no		# yes = synbak will connect to the remote host and will run rsync daemon via sudo command (you must add the specified user into sudoers file. this greatly enhance security)
method_rsync_differential	= no		# yes = rsync differential backup without hardlinks, no = rsync incremental backup via file system hardlinks (use only when your destination doesn't support hardlinks, like a NTFS or FAT32 formatted filesystem)
method_tape_device_changer	= /dev/changer	# the tape changer device path (used in method: tape)
method_verify			= no		# verify the backup (used in method: tape/tar/laserdisc)
method_device_eject		= no		# eject the device at backup end (used in method: tape/laserdisc)

## reports managements
report_remote_uri_down	= yes			# yes = create the reports if the remote host is down. no = don't make any reports if the remote host to backup is down (useful whit laptops)

report_info_support	= InitZero S.r.l. - support@initzero.it	# the techincal support info you want show to your customers

## standard output reporting
report_stdout		= no			# always generate standard output report (override this with -d command line option)
report_stdout_on_errors = no			# generate standard output report on errors only

## email output reporting
report_email		= no					# always generate an email report
report_email_on_errors  = yes					# generate email report on errors only
report_email_rcpt	= root@localhost			# the destination address of email reports

## html/rss output reporting
report_html		= yes					# always generate a html report
report_html_on_errors   = yes					# generate html report on errors only
report_html_destination = /var/www/html/admin/log/backup	# destination dir of html reports
report_html_uri         = http://$HOSTNAME/admin/log/backup 	# http uri of html and rss reports
report_html_logo	= yes					# display a logo in the html report
report_html_logo_image	= 					# http uri or web root relative path of the image logo (empty = use default synbak logo)
report_html_logo_link	= http://www.initzero.it/products/opensource/synbak	# http uri link of the logo


## synbak config file usage:
# 1) put this file in your 'configuration directory'/'method name' and change
#    the name to systemname.conf (ex. /home/username/.synbak/rsync/servername.conf)
#
# 2) if you want execute automatically the backup script (suggested)
#    add to user crontab (crontab -e) a line like this:
#    00 21 * * * synbak -s servername -m rsync

## special system variables usable in this config file (they are case sensitive):
# - $system      (the system name specified in the command line)
# - $method      (the method name specified in the command line)
# - $today       (today     date, in format YYYYMMDD, ex. '20030920')
# - $onedayago   (1 day ago date, in format YYYYMMDD, ex. '20030919')
# - $twodayago   (2 day ago date, in format YYYYMMDD, ex. '20030918')
# - $threedayago (3 day ago date, in format YYYYMMDD, ex. '20030917')
# - $xxxdayago   (so on...)
# - $HOME        (your home directory, ex. '/home/username')
